What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This assignment was very helpful in setting up the armlab environment
and getting familiar with the interactions between different git
repositories on the cloud, the armlab computers, and my local machine.
I also learned a lot about how to use bash to manipulate files and
directories, as well as how to use variables, loops, pipelines, 
globs, and brace expansion. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

I did not find any bugs in my submission. My strategy for 
generating the files in step 3.2 was to loop through both the 
number of rounds (11) and the whole alphabet (a through z),
naming the txt files using the round number followed by the letter to
ensure that bash will glob these files in the desired order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What bash command(s) did you use to generate the files in Step 3.2?

for round in {1..11}; do for letter in {a..z}; do echo $letter > ${round}${letter}.txt;
    done
cat *.txt > cat.txt
